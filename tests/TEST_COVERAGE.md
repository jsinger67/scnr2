# Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

This workspace includes comprehensive tests for the scanner, covering:
- Identifiers, keywords, operators, strings, and punctuation
- Edge cases and fuzzing ([`match_fuzz.rs`](match_fuzz.rs:1))
- Error handling and boundary conditions ([`match_errors.rs`](match_errors.rs:1))
- Performance benchmarks including pathological cases ([`benches/bench.rs`](benches/bench.rs:1))

## Test Files

- [`match_test.rs`](match_test.rs:1): Main test suite (large file - could benefit from splitting)
- [`match_fuzz.rs`](match_fuzz.rs:1): Fuzz and edge-case tests
- [`match_errors.rs`](match_errors.rs:1): Error handling and stress tests
- [`benches/bench.rs`](benches/bench.rs:1): Performance benchmarks

## Edge Cases Covered

### Fuzz Tests ([`match_fuzz.rs`](match_fuzz.rs:1))
- Empty input handling
- Long repeated characters (10,000+ chars)
- Invalid UTF-8 sequences
- Pathological string tokens with many escapes
- Mixed token streams

### Error Tests ([`match_errors.rs`](match_errors.rs:1))
- Invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
- Unterminated strings and escape sequences
- Extremely long tokens (1M+ characters)
- Deeply nested expressions (10,000+ levels)
- Null bytes in input
- Unicode edge cases (emoji, CJK, mathematical symbols)
- Memory stress testing
- Boundary condition scanning

## Error Assertions

All tests include comprehensive error assertions:
- Correct token type identification
- Accurate span calculation
- Graceful handling of invalid input
- No panics on malformed data
- Memory safety under stress

## Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks in [`benches/bench.rs`](benches/bench.rs:1):
- Standard cases: identifiers, keywords, strings
- **Pathological cases**:
  - Extremely long strings (100K+ chars)
  - Invalid UTF-8 sequences
  - Mixed pathological tokens

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by functionality:
- **Unit tests**: Individual scanner features
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end scanning workflows
- **Fuzz tests**: Random and edge-case inputs
- **Error tests**: Invalid input handling
- **Performance tests**: Throughput and pathological cases

## Coverage Metrics

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Normal token scanning
- ✅ Edge case input handling
- ✅ Error conditions and recovery
- ✅ Performance under stress
- ✅ Memory safety
- ✅ Unicode support
- ✅ Boundary conditions

## Future Improvements

- Consider splitting [`match_test.rs`](match_test.rs:1) into focused modules
- Add property-based testing with quickcheck
- Expand Unicode test coverage
- Add more specific regex edge cases
